array_answers

patriots = ['Tom Brady', 'Julian Edelman', 'Rob Gronkowski', 'LeGarrette Blount', 'Chris Hogan', 'Nate Solder']
num = [1, 6, 123, 65, 12, 89, 1264]

1) Find the value of the first element each array
patriots.first
patriots[0]

2) Find the value of the last element each array
patriots.last
patriots[patriots.length-1]

3) Count the number of array elements in both arrays
patriots.count
patriots.length

4) Take the num array and divide every element by 3
num.map { |num| num/3 }

5) Insert “Danny Amendola” in between Tom Brady and Julian Edelman
patriots.insert(1, "Danny Amendola")

6) Write a statement that determines if the patriots array contains “Martellus Bennett”
patriots.include?("Martellus Bennett")

7) Add 56 to the end of the num array
num << 56
num.push(56)

8) Delete Rob Gronkowski
patriots.delete("Rob Gronkowski")

9) Create another array of coaches with Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniels and then join it to the end of patriots array
creating coaches array: coaches = ["Bill Belichick", "Josh 	McDaniels"]
adding coaches array to end: patriots + coaches
							 patriots << coaches
							 patriots.push(coaches)

10) Delete all index position 3 from both arrays
patriots.delete_at(3)
num.delete_at(3)

11) Insert “Vishal Sunak” into position 3 of patriots array
patriots.insert(3, "Vishal Sunak")

12) Use map and multiply every element in the num array by 2.164
	num.map { |num| 2.164*num }

13) See what happens when you try to multiply the patriots array by 5. Why does this happen?
patriots.map { |patriots| 5*patriots }
TypeError: String can't be coerced into Fixnum
This happens becuase the patriots array contains strings which cannot be multiplied by integers

14) Take the num array and return only those values that are bigger than 50
num.keep_if { |num| num > 50 }
num.select { |num| num > 50 }

15) Take the num array and return only the positions of those that are bigger than 50
num.map { |num| num>50 }

16) Add the number “12” to the beginning of each element in the patriots so “12Julian Edelman” is what I’m looking for
patriots.map { |patriots| "12"+patriots }

17) Add “is the greatest” to the end of each element in the patriots array so “Rob Gronkowski is the greatest”
patriots.map { |patriots| patriots+"is the greatest" }

18) Sum the elements of the num array that are divisible by 4
Solve w/ loops

19) Print out on a separate line each element of both arrays
num.each{|a| p a}
patriots.each{|a| p a}

20) Delete every other element in the num array (6, 65, 89) all get deleted
Solve w/ loops

21) Reverse the order of each element in both arrays… so the num array will start with 1264 and the patriots with “Nate Solder”
patriots.reverse_each

22) We’re doing a 2 on 2 drill for the Patriots during practice. Can you help coach figure out all the unique 2 player combinations?
patriots.combination(2).to_a

23) Sort the num array lowest to highest by element value
num.sort { |x,y| x <=> y }

24) Sort the num array highest to lowest by element value
num.sort { |x,y| y <=> x }

25) Return the biggest value of the num array
num.max

26) Return the smallest value of the num array
num.min

27) Sum the entire num array, what’s the value?
num.each {|a| sum = sum + a}

28) Figure out all the unique combinations of 3 number pairs for the num array
num.combination(3).to_a
