players = {'Tom Brady' => 12, 'Rob Gronkowski' => 87, 'Danny Amendola' => 80, 'Julian Edelman' => 11, 'Nate Solder' => 77, 'Dion Lewis' => 33}

0) Return Dion Lewis number
players["Dion Lewis"]

1) Return all the keys of the hash
players.keys

2) Return all the values of the hash
players.values

3) Return all keys sorted alphabetically A to Z
players.keys.sort

4) Return all numbers sorted smallest to largest
players.values.sort

5) Add a new key:value pair on the end for Chris Hogan, 15
players[key:value] << "Chris Hogan" => 15
players.new("Chris Hogan" => 15)

6) Delete Danny Amendola from the hash
players.delete("Danny Amendola")

7) For each key, print out each value on a separate line
players.each_value {|value| puts value }

8) Return the length of players
players.length

9) Research the delete_if and delete any keys and return playes that have a value less than 75
players.delete_if { |k,v| v > 75 }

10) Create a hash called “nfl_teams” and make a hash called “green_bay” and fill it up with players and their jersey numbers of your choice. Rename the original players array to “patriots” and now figure out a way to set the value of “nfl_teams” to be nfl_teams = {patriots { …}, green_bay {...}}
Hashes:
1: green_bay = {"Aaron Rodgers" => 12, "Haha Clinton-Dix" => 21, "Jared Cook" => 89, "Jordy Nelson" => 87, "Clay Matthews" => 52, "Randall Cobb" => 18}
2: patriots = {'Tom Brady' => 12, 'Rob Gronkowski' => 87, 'Danny Amendola' => 80, 'Julian Edelman' => 11, 'Nate Solder' => 77, 'Dion Lewis' => 33}
Command:



11) Take the new green_bay hash and merge it with the original players array above

12) Look at “values_at” method and return the values of Tom Brady and Julian Edelman and then calculate the length of the array returned

13) Sum all the values in the players hash

14) Search through players hash for Tom Brady and see what it returns. Then do the search again on the players hash for Aaron Rodgers

15) Right now the array stores only 1 piece of information, the jersey number. How would you be able to add their position so Tom Brady would have 2 values - 12 and Quarterback. Use what you know about hashes to define multiple values and update players array with positions
